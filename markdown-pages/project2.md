# Description

Information website based on website I created for Level 3 City and Guilds Web Design exam I took in 2012 where the task was to build a website for a ficticious company called Greenfootprints who advocate recycling household waste by proving advice to the general public on recycling. The website was built using HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox and Jquery. The images and text on website are from the actual assets used in the exam. Redesigned the layout into a single page website. Jquery was used to create scrolling page effect. Jquery validator plugin for contact form validation along with HTML5 validation.
